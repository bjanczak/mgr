1)    When we choose projection dimension as pruning criteria we base the comparison on a little slice of data and we loose all other dimension values data.
	  The less efficient algorithm with dimension projection works, the more data is lost while dimensions projection. 
	  This is why such a solution for projection on one dimension works better for low dimensional data than for high dimensional data.
	  So the more data we loose using projection the more inefficient the algorithm becomes.
	  For example if we choose value of dimension 'd' as a pruning criteria, than all the points that has equal value of dimension 'd' are treated the same, despite the fact thay can be freely distant from each other.
	  Therefore lots of points passes to the algorithm phase were real distance is calculated.
