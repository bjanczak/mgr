1)    Reference point is much better pruning criteria than projection dimension. 

      When we choose projection dimension as pruning criteria we base the comparison on a little slice of data and we loose all other dimension values data.
	  The difference in efficiency in favor of reference point is proportional to difference between dataset dimension and the number of dimensions that are used ass projection criteria.
	  So the more data we loose using projection the worse efficiency becomes.
	  For example if we choose value of dimension 'd' as a pruning criteria, than all the points that has equal value of dimension 'd' are treated the same, despite the fact thay can be freely distant from each other.
	  Therefore much more points passes to the algorithm phase were real distance is calculated.
	  
	  Contrary to projection dimensions, using distance to reference does not have the data loose malfunction. Here points treated the same by the pruning criteria must lay on the surface of the same sphere which
	  center lays in reference point, which is far less probable than they had common projection dimension value.
	  Therefore much less points passes to the algorithm phase were real distance is calculated comparing to projection dimension.
