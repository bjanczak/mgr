1)	k_neighborhood can't classify, it needs calculating distance to reference point.
2)	sorting is done using all available criteria.
3)  placing is fucked up.
4)  should posotioning be added to algorithms calculation time
5)  Verification report:
	+5a) Code review.
	+5b) Comparison tests.	
	+5c) Profiler.
	+5d) Gathering data.
6)
	6a) DBSCAN and TI_DBSCAN shows distance / point representation / dataset characteristic differences (DBSCAN *_60, TI-DBSCAN *_120).
	6b) TI_DBSCAN shows choosing reference point difference for high dimensional data and how (>*_120).
	6c) TI_DBSCAN_REF shows choosing reference point difference and it's ordering for high dimensional data
	6d) TI_DBSCAN_REF_PROJECTION shows that projection is a poor pruning criteria.

7)  do all datasets should have the same querry or should it have querry that returns some clusters?

8) test index against not index access to data?
